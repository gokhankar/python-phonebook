# python-phonebook
Several phonebooks with different specialities written in Python 
You can find in this repository:
  1- A console phone book that basicly writes contacts in a contacts.txt file. And it has a language option(Turkish) that is written with only using functions. Phonebook has two different versions.
  2- A phonebook workout with a basic UI written with Python and PyQt5. That is a nonfinished version but it works and it is funny.
  3- A console phonebook that writes contacts as instances of classes and did not saved to a database or file. Therefore saved contacts are stored in the memory, they can be achieved fastly when needed and erased when quited. Tried to understand OOP and Python Classes. Contact class and Phonebook class are the main classes of the program.
